Welcome to the ES-DE Android Game Cover repository! This unique repository features weekly releases of high resolution cover art for the top Android games. Our mission? We won't rest until we achieve complete coverage of the modern Android gaming library.

ðŸ’»  Looking for covers for your apps and emulators? Check out our sister project [ES-DE Android App Covers](https://github.com/nahnotnathan/esde-android-app-covers/)

## Usage
To start using these covers, simply download the images you want and drop them in your following path:

``` ~/ES-DE/downloaded_media/androidgames/covers ```

*Note: If you have renamed your app or game in ES-DE, you will have to rename the cover to the exact same filename, minus the extension.*

## Features
- **High Quality Images:** Each cover is meticulously crafted and exported in Lossless PNG format offering excellent visual clarity and consistency across covers.
- **Curated Collection:** Don't dig through mountains of Steam Grid trash. This collection has everything you need and nothing you don't
- **Free to Use:** All covers in this repository are completely free for personal use.

## Get Involved
This is an interactive community project that has two great ways to participate:

**1. Contribute**

If you have moderate Photoshop & Illustrator skills and are comfortable using AI in your design work flow, you can easily help out in just a few minutes each week by contributing cover designs.

**2. Request Your Favorites**

Got a favorite game that we haven't designed yet? Let us know! We actively review suggestions made in the Pull Requests and prioritize suggestions with the highest vote count.

## Acknowledgements
This project is a labor of love born out of my belief that gaming on Android can and should be better. I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to the following contributors and community who make this hobby great:

- The entire team at [ES-DE](https://gitlab.com/es-de/emulationstation-de) for making the most flexible, open-source Android front-end on the market
- Russ from [Retro Game Corps](https://www.youtube.com/c/RetroGameCorps) and [ETA Prime](https://www.youtube.com/@ETAPRIME) for getting me into this hobby
- All of the fine folks on [/r/SBCGaming/](https://reddit.com/r/sbcgaming/), [/r/Retroid/](https://reddit.com/r/retroid/), [/r/EmulationOnAndroid](https://reddit.com/r/emulationonandroid/), and [/r/AndroidGaming](https://reddit.com/r/androidgaming/)
- The largely anonymous emulator developers who somehow find the energy to bang their head against a wall enough times to create massive breakthroughs for all of us
- And you, for picking up this pack!

Game on.
